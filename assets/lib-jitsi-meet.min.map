Class implements <tt>LoggerTransport</tt>\n * and thus can be added as global transport in order to capture all the logs.\n *\n * It captures subsequent log lines created whenever <tt>Logger</tt> logs\n * a message and stores them in a queue in order to batch log entries. There are\n * time and size limit constraints which determine how often batch entries are\n * stored. Whenever one of these limits is exceeded the <tt>LogCollector</tt>\n * will use the <tt>logStorage</tt> object given as an argument to save\n * the batch log entry.\n *\n * @param {Object} logStorage an object which allows to store the logs collected\n * @param {function(string|object[])} logStorage.storeLogs a method called when\n * this <tt>LogCollector</tt> requests log entry storage. The method's argument\n * is an array which can contain <tt>string</tt>s and <tt>object</tt>s. If given\n * item is an object it means that it's an aggregated message. That is a message\n * which is the same as the previous one and it's representation has\n * the following format:\n * {\n *   {string} text: 'the text of some duplicated message'\n *   {number} count: 3 // how many times the message appeared in a row\n * }\n * If a message \"B\" after an aggregated message \"A\" is different, then it breaks\n * the sequence of \"A\". Which means that even if the next message \"C\" is\n * the same as \"A\" it will start a new aggregated message \"C\".\n * @param {function()} logStorage.isReady a method which should return\n * a <tt>boolean</tt> to tell the collector that it's ready to store. During the\n * time storage is not ready log batches will be cached and stored on the next\n * occasion (flush or interval timeout).\n *\n * @param {Object} options the <tt>LogCollector</tt> configuration options.\n * @param {number} options.maxEntryLength the size limit for a single log entry\n * to be stored. The <tt>LogCollector</tt> will push the entry as soon as it\n * reaches or exceeds this limit given that <tt>logStorage.isReady</tt>\n * returns <tt>true</tt>. Otherwise the log entry will be cached until the log\n * storage becomes ready. Note that the \"is ready\" condition is checked every\n * <tt>options.storeInterval</tt> milliseconds.\n * @param {number} options.storeInterval how often the logs should be stored in\n * case <tt>maxEntryLength</tt> was not exceeded.\n * @param {boolean} options.stringifyObjects indicates whether or not object\n * arguments should be \"stringified\" with <tt>JSON.stringify</tt> when a log\n * message is composed. Note that objects logged on the error log level are\n * always stringified.\n *\n * @constructor\n */\nfunction LogCollector(logStorage, options) {\n    this.logStorage = logStorage;\n    this.stringifyObjects = options && options.stringifyObjects ? options.stringifyObjects : false;\n    this.storeInterval = options && options.storeInterval ? options.storeInterval: 30000;\n    this.maxEntryLength = options && options.maxEntryLength ? options.maxEntryLength : 10000;\n    // Bind the log method for each level to the corresponding method name\n    // in order to implement \"global log transport\" object.\n    Object.keys(Logger.levels).forEach(\n    function (logLevel) {\n        var methodName = Logger.levels[logLevel];\n        this[methodName] = function () {\n            this._log.apply(this, arguments);\n        }.bind(this, logLevel);\n    }.bind(this));\n    /**\n     * The ID of store logs interval if one is currently scheduled or\n     * <tt>null</tt> otherwise.\n     * @type {number|null}\n     */\n    this.storeLogsIntervalID = null;\n    /**\n     * The log messages that are to be batched into log entry when\n     * {@link LogCollector._flush} method is called.\n     * @type {string[]}\n     */\n    this.queue = [];\n    /**\n     * The total length of all messages currently stored in the {@link queue}.\n     * @type {number}\n     */\n    this.totalLen = 0;\n    /**\n     * An array used to temporarily store log batches, before the storage gets\n     * ready.\n     * @type {string[]}\n     */\n    this.outputCache = [];\n}\n\n/**\n * Method called inside of {@link formatLogMessage} in order to covert an\n * <tt>Object</tt> argument to string.
